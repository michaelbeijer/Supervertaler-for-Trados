The Term Picker is a compact overlay that shows all matched terms for the current segment in a sortable, keyboard-navigable list. It is useful when TermLens shows many matches and you want a quick overview without scrolling.

### Opening the Term Picker

Press **Ctrl+Shift+P** to open the Term Picker. It appears as a floating window above the editor.

{% hint style="info" %}
Looking for the memoQ-style Ctrl-tap behaviour? That now opens the [TermLens popup](termlens-popup.md) – a more compact in-context view of the same matches. The Term Picker dialogue described on this page is the list-based alternative for users who prefer a tabular UI.
{% endhint %}

### Colour-coded rows

Each row in the Term Picker is colour-coded by termbase type:

| Colour     | Meaning                             |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Pink**   | Project termbase term               |
| **Blue**   | Regular Supervertaler termbase term |
| **Yellow** | Non-translatable term               |
| **Green**  | MultiTerm termbase term (`.sdltb`)  |

This lets you instantly see where each term comes from and how it should be handled.

### Expandable synonyms

Terms with multiple translations display a right-arrow indicator (**▸**) next to the term. To expand and see all synonym sub-rows:

* Select the row and press the **Right arrow** key
* The sub-rows appear below the parent term, showing each available translation

Press **Left arrow** to collapse the synonyms again.

### Keyboard navigation

The Term Picker is designed for fast keyboard use:

| Key           | Action                                        |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **0-9**       | Type a number to jump directly to that term   |
| **Enter**     | Insert the selected term and close the picker |
| **Escape**    | Close the picker without inserting            |
| **Up / Down** | Navigate between terms (wraps around)         |
| **Right**     | Expand synonyms for the selected term         |
| **Left**      | Collapse synonyms                             |

Navigation wraps around: pressing **Down** on the last term jumps to the first, and **Up** on the first jumps to the last.

### Inserting a term

You can insert a term in two ways:

* **Click** any row to insert that term at the cursor position in the target field
* **Press Enter** on the selected row to insert and close

The selected translation is placed at the current cursor position in the target segment.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Term Picker shows the same matches as TermLens, but in a flat list format that is easier to scan when there are many results.
